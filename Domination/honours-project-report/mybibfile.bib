The needs of today's games are outgrowing the typical techniques of modeling behavior with Finite State Machines and Rule Based Systems.  This paper argues that a regressive real-time planning system is better suited to address the challenges game developers are facing, and presents symbolic representation strategies that we have employed to allow planning in practice
